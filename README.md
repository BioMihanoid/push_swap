# Push_swap
Because Swap_push isn’t as natural

## Description
This project will make you sort data on a stick, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

## Project goals

1. Learn algorithms for sorting numbers
2. Come up with your own optimal algorithm for sorting numbers

## How to compile/to run

You open console in Linux/MacOS and enter the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/BioMihanoid/push_swap
cd push_swap
make
./push_swap [any_set_of_numbers]
```

P.S. Word written after ./push_swap are any array values.
